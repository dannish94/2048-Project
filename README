The AI Solution of 2048 - Dannish Hussain.

The code used in the creation of the GUI for the game 2048, was created by a user called 'Fatal Cubez'.
He made a series of youtube videos where he created the game in Java, using the MVC architecture. 
Full credit belongs to him for the GUI, I have simply used his implementation of the game so that I can use various AI techniques on.
I have made a few tweaks to the design to personalise to my project.

You can find his youtube channel and his series of videos that he created at: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjWH41laf9U4fbLixS9eOBQ/feed

Also to note, there were no comments made by the author so any comments found in the project are from me, 
most likely the addition of extra features that i have added myself.
